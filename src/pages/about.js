    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Helmar I was born in Germany and I have been living and working in the United Kingdom for more than 5 years now. After working in Athens for Dropbox where I was enjoying the sun, excellent food, and beautiful beaches. I have moved to Vietnam escaping the winter in Europe and working on different projects.
    I have created my first blog on WordPress in 2016 and now I am switching to Angular the most popular Framework powered by GOOGLE After working on multiple projects in Germany new options have been created for me. Early 2014 I have relocated to Bournemouth, England at the South Coast not far from the Heritage Coast and the Jurassic Coast. It is said that they have the most beautiful beach in the United Kingdom and I must say I loved it. I used to work in Poole for Google Payment Service and Google Apps in an international team of different languages. Becoming more GOOGLEY then and for more than a decade, I have been using their services and tools. In September 2015 have made my decision to take a step forward and moved to London, the Hotspot on the planet. I had worked for the well-known brand BOSCH as a Technical Professional before I was hired by AXA Travel but this was not the job I was aiming for. After I returned from my trip to Vietnam I was offered a job as Data Analyst in Sunbury-on-Thames where I was able to commute by bicycle every day that kept me fit and saved me time and money. Apart from that, it was a contractor job role with a good daily rate and flexible shifts. When I am not working and I am not busy with Web Development, I do sport like cycling, running and swimming, occasionally I go skiing in the Switzerland Mountains. I very much like traveling, it is the best way of gaining a new perspective, new points of view about leading my life. As a German national and native speaker I am fluent in English, and having basic knowledge in Spanish, French, and Russian.
    Trading stocks, forex and indices is my passion
