###How to set up GOOGLE Analytics
####and using it as a digital marketing tool

Google Analytics is a very important digital marketing tool, but seriously underused by most businesses and website owners. It allows you to measure the results of individual campaigns in real-time and compare the data to previous periods. You obtain insight of demographics, location, behaviour, interests, technology and so much more

Log in with your Google account if you donâ€™t have one yet simply create a new account and get all the advantages that GOOGLE offers, like Gmail, Youtube, Drive, Photos and many more



Google Analytics is a tool that is connected to your website through a piece of tracking code. This is a small piece of JavaScript code that is made within your analytics account. You can generate this code and then place it into the HTML head section of your website. On WordPress you only have to add the Tracking ID on the Plugin.
